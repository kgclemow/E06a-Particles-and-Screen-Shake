# E06a-Particles-and-Screen-Shake

This exercise was completed for a C220 game technology class at IU using Godot and GDScript. The purpose of the exercise was to familiarize myself with using the Particles 2D node in order to create different effects (fire, rain, and plasma) by making various adjustments to the particle material settings in the inspector panel. Also, The expercise provided proper script in order to finish and implement a screen shake using the WASD keys.
